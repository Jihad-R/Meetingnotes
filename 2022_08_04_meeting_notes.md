On the 8th of April 2022, we had our first meeting. The meeting was held over zoom. During the meeting, the team members, at the time, discussed different possible research topics. Each member expressed their thoughts on the topics. Then the team made a poll where each member voted on a topic they deemed interesting. Finally, the team agreed on the ‘Sensor-based State-estimation of hospital beds’ as the project topic to pursue.
