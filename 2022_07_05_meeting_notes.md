### Agenda - Discussing the Literature Review

On the 7th of May 2022, We have had a group meeting where we discussed the methodology we will use to make the literature review. We proposed a couple of scientific journal search engines. Afterwards, we shared our search queries with one another and then later divided them among each other. Finally, we agreed on dedicating 2 hours a day on the literature review and the project in general.
