### Agenda - Equipment Testing and P**reliminary** Data Collection

On the 5th of May 2022, we organized our first meeting with the supervisor. Furthermore, we requested access to the R321 lab at the Konrad Zuse Haus. During the meeting, we tested the equipment provided and tried to see the format of the data we are receiving. We also checked the reliability of each sensor. We had some issues with the time-of-flight sensors. These issues probably rose from the black carpet in the lab that is absorbing the light as a result the time-of-flight sensors are giving inaccurate readings. The thermal sensor is working as expected but the reading may be affected by the room temperature and the underground heat pipes. At last, we have collected some data to train a basic model and planned for a meeting to start our literature review.
