### Agenda - Meeting with the Supervisor

On the 27th of April, we had our first meeting with the supervisor and Dr Sebastian Bader. Our Supervisor, PhD Candidate, Ole Fenske gave us an idea of the scope of the project and what is required from us to complete it. They advised us to look into the documentation of the code and the existing system to have a better understanding of the project. We were also suggested to read into topics such as *sensor fusion, occupancy detection, PIR sensors, time-of-flight sensors* etc. Moreover, we were recommended to look into the literature related to our problem statement. Finally, after the meeting with the supervisors, the team decided to plan a new meeting where they can test the equipment.

### What has happened since the last meeting?

- ‘Sensor-based State-estimation of hospital beds’ was selected as the topic of our project
